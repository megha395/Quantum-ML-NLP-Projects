# Quantum vs Classical LSTM for Tweet Sentiment Classification

This repository explores the comparison between **Classical LSTM** and **Quantum LSTM (QLSTM)** models on a real-world **Tweet Sentiment Classification** task using custom GPT2-based tokenization, TensorFlow/Keras, and Qiskit. The goal is to understand the potential and limitations of quantum-enhanced deep learning models in NLP.
